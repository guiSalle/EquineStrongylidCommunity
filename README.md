# EquineStrongylidCommunity

These R scripts implement the analyses reported in Boisseau et al. 2022, Patterns of variation in equine strongyle community structure across age groups and gut compartments. Associated raw data have been published under the INRAE data repository: https://doi:10.57745/FQ7RUA. 

* ``` IndividualDiversity.R ``` : R script used to investigate the relationship between the diversity (species richness and dominance) in equine strongylid community from Eastern Europe (Kuzmina et al. 2016, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.07.024 ; Sall√© et al. 2018, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2858-9).

* ``` HorseAgeAnalysis.R ``` : R script to re-analyze the relationship between horse age and the strongylid community structure. Data from Kuzmina et al. 2016 were used to apply a diversity partitioning approach (Crist et al. 2003, https://doi.org/10.1086/378901).

* ``` HmscAustralia.R ``` and ``` HmscNormandy.R ``` : R scripts to implement the HSMC framework (https://github.com/hmsc-r/HMSC) and estimate species co-occurrences (environment dependent and residual components) from positive abundances or presence/absence data. These codes have been adapted from a previous publication (https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15516 and code deposited at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.9kd51c5dp). This analysis was applied to two observations collected in Normandy, France (https://doi.org/10.1016/s0304-4017(02)00328-x) and Victoria State, Australia (https://doi.org/10.1016/0020-7519(94)00214-9).
